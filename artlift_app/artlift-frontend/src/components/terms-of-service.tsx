  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>Introduction Acceptance</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a binding legal agreement between you (“User,” “Artist,” or “Collector”) and the operators of [Service Name] (“the Service,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By creating an account, uploading artwork, or accessing the platform, you agree to abide by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>2. Ownership and Operation</h2>
  <p>The Service is operated as a partnership between [Name 1] and [Name 2] (collectively, "the Operators").</p>
  <li>Contact: [Your Email Address]</li>
  <li>Location: These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your Country]. We reserve the right to update our primary jurisdiction should the legal structure of the partnership change in the future.</li>
  
  <h2>3. Eligibility and Account Security</h2>
<li>Age: You must be at least [13/16/18] years old to use this Service.</li>
<li>Account Responsibility: You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials. Any activity occurring under your account is your legal responsibility.</li>

<h2>4. Intellectual Property & User Content</h2>
<p>We are an artist-first platform and respect your creative rights.</p>

<li>Ownership: You retain 100% ownership of the original artwork you upload.</li>
<li>License Grant: By posting content, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license strictly to store, compress, and display your work for the purpose of operating the Service (e.g., displaying your art in feeds, profiles, and search results).</li>
<li>AI Protection Clause: We respect human creativity. We will not use your uploaded artwork to train generative AI models without your explicit, separate opt-in consent.</li>

<h2>5. Community Interaction & Collaborations</h2>
<p>Our Service allows Artists, Buyers, and Collectors to connect.</p>

<li>Professional Conduct: Users must interact respectfully. Harassment, hate speech, spam, or bad-faith targeting of other users are grounds for immediate account termination.</li>
<li>Collaborations: If you use the Service to organize a collaboration with another artist, the Service acts only as the venue. Any agreements regarding "co-ownership," "split profits," or creative control are strictly between the individual users.</li>

<h2>6. User Disputes (Release of Liability)</h2>
<p>We are not a mediator.</p>

<li>No Involvement in Disputes: You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users. The Operators strictly will not intervene in personal arguments, creative disputes, or disagreements regarding private transactions between users.</li>
<li>Release: By using the Service, you release the Operators from any claims, demands, and damages arising out of disputes with other users or parties.</li>

<h2> Future Commerce & Payments</h2>
<p>While the Service currently focuses on connection and display, you acknowledge that:</p>

<li>Third-Party Payments: Future sales of goods or artwork will be processed through third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).</li>
<li>Taxes: Artists are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes required by their local jurisdiction for income generated through connections made on the platform.</li>

<h2>8. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>

<li>Post "Scraped" or stolen content that you do not own the rights to.</li>
<li>Use the Service to distribute malware or engage in automated "bot" activity.</li>
<li>Engage in "Art Theft" or misrepresent the authorship of any work.</li>

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability ("As-Is" Clause)</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided "As-Is" and "As Available." The Operators are not liable for:</p>
<li>Indirect or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service.</li>
<li>Theft or unauthorized use of your artwork by third parties (e.g., "Right-Click Saving" by visitors).</li>
<li>Data loss or temporary service downtime. Please maintain your own local backups of your artwork.</li>

<h2>10. Modifications to Terms</h2>
<p>As we grow from a community hub to a marketplace, these Terms will evolve. We will notify you of significant changes via the email associated with your account or a prominent notice on the platform. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
